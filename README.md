Basic Concepts
Arrays
Arrays are versatile data structures that enable you to manage collections of elements efficiently.

Example:
javascript
Copy code
const fruits = ['apple', 'orange', 'banana'];
console.log(fruits[1]); // Outputs: orange
Objects
Objects are key-value pairs and a cornerstone of JavaScript, offering a way to structure and organize data.

Example:
javascript
Copy code
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 25,
  city: 'New York'
};
console.log(person.name); // Outputs: John
ES11 (ES2020)
ES11, or ES2020, brought new features and enhancements to the JavaScript language.

Example:
javascript
Copy code
// Optional Chaining
const user = {
  profile: {
    address: {
      city: 'London'
    }
  }
};

console.log(user.profile?.address?.city); // Outputs: London
